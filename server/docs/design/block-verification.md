## Purpose
The purpose of the Block Verification feature is to ensure that blocks received from consensus nodes are valid and have not been tampered with. This is achieved by re-calculating the block hash and verifying it against the signature provided by the consensus node.

## Goals
1. The block-node must re-create the block hash from the block items and verify that it matches the hash implied by the signature. 
1. If verification fails, the block should be considered invalid, and appropriate error-handling procedures must be triggered.

## Terms
<dl>
<dt>Consensus Node (CN)</dt><dd>A node that produces and provides blocks.</dd>
<dt>Block Items</dt><dd>The block data pieces (header, events, transactions, transaction result, state changes, proof) that make up a block.</dd>
<dt>Block Hash</dt><dd>A cryptographic hash representing the blockâ€™s integrity.</dd>
<dt>Signature</dt><dd>The cryptographic signature of the block hash created by Network private key (aka: LedgerId).</dd>
<dt>Public Key</dt><dd>The public key of the LedgerId that signed the block.</dd>
</dl>

## Entities

- #### VerificationHandler
  - Receives the stream of block items in the form of List<BlockItemsUnparsed> from the unparsed and unverified block items ring buffer. 
  - When it detects a block_header, it creates a BlockHashingSession using the BlockHashingSessionFactory, providing it with the initial block items (and internally, the session will handle asynchronous hashing).
  - Adds subsequent block items to the session, including the block_proof.
  - Does not block waiting for verification; the hash computation and verification continue asynchronously.  
- ### BlockHashingSessionFactory
  - Creates new BlockHashingSession instances, provides them with a ExecutorService.
- ### BlockHashingSession
  - Holds all necessary block data while it is waiting to hash it.
  - Accepts block items incrementally. (continues to compute them asynchronously)
  - Once the block_proof is provided, finalizes the hash computation asynchronously.
  - After computing the final hash, calls SignatureVerifier for verification.
- ### SignatureVerifier
  - Verifies the block signature is valid (using the ledger ID) and signed the same hash that was computed by the `BlockHashingSession`.
  - Report results to BlockStatusManager.
- ### BlockStatusManager
  - Receives verification results from SignatureVerifier.
  - Updates block status and triggers any necessary recovery or follow-up processes depending on the outcome.

## Design
1. The `VerificationHandler` receives the list of block items from the unverified ring buffer.
1. When the block_header is detected, the `VerificationHandler` creates a `BlockHashingSession` using the `BlockHashingSessionFactory`.
1. The `BlockHashingSession` accepts subsequent block items incrementally.
1. Once the block_proof is received, the `BlockHashingSession` calls `completeHashing()` to finalize the hash computation.
1. Upon completion of computing the final block hash, the `BlockHashingSession` calls the `SignatureVerifier` to verify the signature.
1. The `SignatureVerifier` compares the computed hash to the hash signed by the Block Proof signature.
1. If the verification fails, the `SignatureVerifier` calls the `BlockStatusManager` to update the block status as SIGNATURE_INVALID.
1. If the verification succeeds, the `SignatureVerifier` calls the `BlockStatusManager` to update the block status as VERIFIED.
1. The `BlockStatusManager` initiates any necessary recovery or follow-up processes depending on the verification result.

## Interfaces

### VerificationHandler
```java
public interface VerificationHandler {
  void onBlockItemsReceived(List<BlockItem> blockItems);  
}
```

### BlockHashingSessionFactory
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;

public interface BlockHashingSessionFactory {
  BlockHashingSession createSession(List<BlockItem> initialBlockItems, ExecutorService executorService, SignatureVerifier signatureVerifier);
}
```

### BlockHashingSession
```java
public interface BlockHashingSession {
  void addBlockItem(BlockItem item);
  CompletableFuture<Void> completeHashing();
}
```

### SignatureVerifier
```java
public interface SignatureVerifier {
  void verifySignature(byte[] signature, byte[] computedHash, long blockNumber);  
}
```

### BlockStatusManager
```java

public interface BlockStatusManager {
    void updateBlockStatus(long blockNumber, BlockVerificationStatus status, VerificationError error);
}
```

## Enums
```java
public enum BlockVerificationStatus {
  VERIFIED,
  ERROR
}

public enum VerificationError {
  NONE,
  SIGNATURE_INVALID,
  SYSTEM_ERROR
}
```

## Configuration
As with other services already implemented in the Block Node system, the current Block Verification Service should be able to be configurable via a Config Object `VerificationConfig` and all the configuration properties defined in here and the configuration document.
<dl>
  <dt>verification.enabled</dt> 
    <dd> enables or disables the verification handler as another subscriber of the unverified ring buffer.</dd>
  <dt>verification.hashAlgorithm</dt>
    <dd>by default and for starters there will only be support for `SHA389`.</dd>
  <dt>verification.executorWorkers</dt>
    <dd> how many workers to create with the verification async pool. by default five (5). </dd>
</dl>
*note: after the actual implementation these properties could change, however they should have its own configuration object, all the added properties should be updated here and in the configuration doc.

## Metrics
<dl>
<dt>blocks_received</dt><dd>Counter of the number of blocks received for verification.</dd>
<dt>blocks_verified</dt><dd>Counter of the number of blocks verified.</dd>
<dt>blocks_unverified</dt><dd>Counter of the number of blocks that have not been verified, is the difference between blocks_received and blocks_verified.</dd>
<dt>blocks_signature_invalid</dt><dd>Counter of the number of blocks with invalid signatures.</dd>
<dt>blocks_system_error</dt><dd>Counter of the number of blocks with system errors.</dd>
<dt>block_verification_time</dt><dd>Histogram of the time taken to verify a block, gives the node operator an idea of the time taken to verify a block.</dd>
</dl>

## Exceptions
- **SYSTEM_ERROR:** Issues with node configuration or bugs. The node logs details, updates metrics, and might attempt recovery or halt.
- **SIGNATURE_INVALID:** If verification fails, SIGNATURE_INVALID is used. The block is marked invalid, and the BlockStatusManager triggers error-handling routines (requesting re-sends, removing corrupted data, notifying subscribers, etc.).

### Signature invalid
If the computed hash does not match the hash signed by the network, the block is considered unverified. It is marked as such and publishers are requested to resend the block.
