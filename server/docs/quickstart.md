## Configuration

Refer to the [Configuration](configuration.md) for configuration options.

## Running locally:

- Server subproject qualifier: `:server`
- Assuming your working directory is the repo root

> **NOTE:** one may use the `-p` flag for `./gradlew` in order to avoid
> specifying the target subproject repeatedly on each task when running
> multiple tasks. When running only a single task, however, it is
> recommended to use the project qualifier (i.e. `:server:`) for
> both simplicity and clarity.

### Build the Server

> **NOTE:** if you have not done so already, it is
> generally recommended to build the entire repo first:
> ```bash
> ./gradlew clean build -x test
> ```

1. To quickly build the Server sources (without running tests), do the following:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew -p server clean build -x test
   ```

1. To build the Server docker image, do the following:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :server:createDockerImage
   ```

### Run the Server

1. To start the Server, do the following:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :server:startDockerContainer
   ```

### Run the Server with Debug

1. To start the Server with debug enabled, do the following:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :server:startDockerDebugContainer
   ```

1. Attach your remote jvm debugger to port 5005.

### Stop the Server

1. To stop the Server do the following:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :server:stopDockerContainer
   ```
