# Server Configuration

The components of the Hedera Block Node all support loading configuration via the
environment.

## Default Values

The default configuration allows users to quickly get up and running without having to configure anything. This provides
ease of use at the trade-off of some insecure default configuration. Most configuration settings have appropriate
defaults and can be left unchanged. It is recommended to browse the properties below and adjust to your needs.
