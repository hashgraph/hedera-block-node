## Overview of child modules

- `server`: implementation of the block node, which contains the main application and all the necessary code to run the block node.
- `simulator`: A simulator for the block node, which can be used to test the block node in a local environment.
- `common`: Module responsible for holding common literals, utilities and types used by the other modules.
- `suites`: A set of e2e tests that can be used to verify the correctness of the block node.
- `tools`: A set of command line tools for working with block stream files.
