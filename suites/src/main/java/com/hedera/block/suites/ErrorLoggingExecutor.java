 * An executor service that extends {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} to provide custom configurations

 * <ul>
 *   <li>Core pool size: 8 threads
 *   <li>Maximum pool size: 8 threads
 *   <li>Keep-alive time: 10 seconds
 *   <li>Work queue: {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} with default capacity
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The executor overrides the {@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)} method to capture and log
 * any exceptions thrown during task execution, including exceptions thrown from {@code Runnable} tasks
 * and uncaught exceptions from {@code Future} tasks. This aids in debugging and error tracking
 * by ensuring that all exceptions are properly logged.

     * was thrown during execution, but the task is an instance of {@code Future} and is done, it attempts to retrieve
     * the result or exception from the {@code Future}. Any exceptions encountered are then logged.
